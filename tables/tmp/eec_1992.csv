At the time of the first reduction, Member States shall, in respect of each product, bring into force as between themselves a duty equal to the basic duty less 10 per cent. At the time of each subsequent reduction, each Member State shall reduce the total of the duties in such a way as to reduce by 10 per cent its total customs receipts as defined in paragraph 4, it being understood that the reduction in the case of each product shall be equal to at least 5 per cent of the basic duty.

In the case of the Italian tariff, however, the duty applied shall be understood as being that levied before the temporary 10 per cent reduction. Furthermore, in the case of tariff headings in regard to which this tariff contains a conventional duty, this duty shall be substituted for the duty applied as defined above, provided that it does not exceed the latter by more than 10 per cent. If the conventional duty exceeds the applied duty as defined above by more than 10 per cent, the latter duty, increased by 10 per cent, shall be taken into account for calculating the arithmetical average. With regard to the tariff headings contained in List A, the duties shown in that List shall, for the purpose of calculating the arithmetical average, be substituted for the duties applied. 3.

The Commission shall take due account of the protective aspect of such duties. Within a period of not more than six months after the Commission has so determined, any Member State may request that the procedure provided for in Article 20 shall be applied to the product concerned; the limit prescribed in that Article shall not constitute a valid objection."
3.3.1.1.2.23,23,"Article 23 1. For the purpose of the progressive introduction of the common customs tariff, Member States shall amend their tariffs applicable to third countries in the following manner: (a) in the case of tariff headings on which the duties in fact applied on 1 January 1957 do not differ by more than 15 per cent in either direction from the duties under the common customs tariff, the latter duties shall be applied at the end of the fourth year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty; (b) in the case of the other tariff headings, each Member State shall, as from the same date, apply a duty which reduces by 30 per cent the difference between the duty in fact applied on 1 January 1957 and that under the common customs tariff; (c) at the end of the second stage this difference shall again be reduced by 30 per cent; and (d) in the case of tariff headings for which the duties under the common customs tariff are not yet known at the end of the first stage, each Member State shall, within a period of six months after the Council has acted in accordance with the provisions of Article 20, apply such duties as shall result from the application of the rules contained in this paragraph. 2. Any Member State, which has been granted the authorisation provided for in Article 17, paragraph 4, shall, for as long as that authorisation is valid, be exempted from applying the preceding provisions to the tariff headings covered by the authorisation. At the expiry of such authorisation, the Member State concerned shall apply such duty as would result from the application of the rules contained in the preceding paragraph. 3.

If the Commission finds that the production in the Member States of certain products contained in Lists B, C and D is not sufficient to supply the demands of one of them and that such supply traditionally depends to a considerable extent upon imports coming from third countries, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall grant to the Member State concerned tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free. Such quotas may not exceed the limits beyond which the transfer of activities to the detriment of other Member States is to be feared. 2. In respect of the products in List E and those in List G for which the duties shall have been fixed in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 20, third paragraph, the Commission shall, at the request of any Member State concerned, grant to such State tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free, where a change in sources of supply or a shortage of supplies within the Community is of such a nature as to entail harmful consequences for the processing industries of the Member State concerned. Such quotas may not exceed the limits beyond which the transfer of activities to the detriment of other Member States is to be feared. 3. In respect of the products listed in Annex II to this Treaty, the Commission may authorise any Member State to suspend, in whole or in part, the collection of the duties applicable or may grant to such Member State tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free, provided that no serious disturbance in the market of the products concerned may result therefrom. 4.

Where, in the case of a product which has not been liberalised, the global quota does not amount to 3 per cent of the national output of the State concerned, a quota equal to not less than 3 per cent of such output shall be established not later than one year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. At the end of the second year, this quota shall be raised to 4 per cent and at the end of the third year to 5 per cent. Thereafter, the Member State concerned shall increase the quota by not less than 15 per cent annually. In the case where there is no such national output, the Commission shall fix an appropriate quota by means of a decision. 3. At the end of the tenth year, each quota shall be equal to not less than 20 per cent of the national output. 4. Where the Commission, acting by means of a decision, finds that in the course of two successive years the imports of any product have been below the level of the quota granted, this global quota may not be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the total value of the global quotas. In such case, the Member State shall abolish the quota for the product concerned. 5. In the case of quotas representing more than 20 per cent of the national output of the product concerned, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may reduce the minimum percentage of 10 per cent laid down in paragraph 1. This modification shall not, however, affect the obligation annually to increase the total value of global quotas by 20 per cent. 6. Member States which have gone beyond their obligations concerning the level of liberalisation attained in implementation of the decisions of the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation of 14 January 1955 shall, when calculating the annual total increase of 20 per cent provided for in paragraph 1, be entitled to take into account the amount of imports liberalised by autonomous measures. Such calculation shall be submitted to the Commission for its prior approval. 7. Directives issued by the Commission shall lay down the procedure and the timing according to which Member States shall abolish as between themselves any measures which exist at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty and which have an effect equivalent to quotas. 8. If the Commission finds that the application of the provisions of this Article and, in particular, of the provisions concerning percentages does not make it possible to ensure the progressive nature of the abolition of quotas provided for in Article 32, second paragraph, the Council, acting during the first stage by means of a unanimous vote and subsequently by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may amend the procedure referred to in this Article and may, in particular, raise the percentages fixed."

The timing of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adapted to the abolition, as provided for in Articles 30 to 34 inclusive, of the quantitative restrictions on the same products. In cases where a product is subject to a State monopoly of a commercial character in one Member State or certain Member States only, the Commission may authorise the other Member States to apply, for as long as the adjustment referred to in paragraph 1 has not been carried out, measures of safeguard of which it shall determine the conditions and particulars. 4. In the case of a monopoly of a commercial character which is accompanied by regulations designed to facilitate the marketing or the valorisation of agricultural products, it should be ensured that in the application of the rules of this Article equivalent guarantees are provided in respect of the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, due account being taken of the timing in respect of possible adjustments and of necessary specialisations. 5.

In the second case, the minimum prices shall not include customs duties. 2. The minimum prices shall not be such as to lead to a reduction of exchanges existing between Member States at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty and shall not be an obstacle to a progressive expansion of such exchanges.

Upon the entry unto force of this Treaty, the Council, acting on a proposal of the Commission, shall determine objective criteria for the establishment of minimum price systems and for the fixing of such prices. The criteria shall, in particular, take account of average national costs of production in the Member State applying the minimum price, of the situation of the various enterprises in relation to such costs and of the need for promoting both the progressive improvement of agricultural operations and the adjustments and specialisations necessary within the Common Market. The Commission shall also propose a procedure for revision of these criteria in order to take into account and accelerate technical progress and in order progressively to approximate prices within the Common Market. These criteria and the procedure for revision shall be determined by means of a unanimous vote of the Council in the course of the first three years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. 4.

From the beginning of the third stage and in cases where it has not yet been possible in respect of certain products to establish the above objective criteria, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may modify the minimum prices applied to these products. 6. At the expiry of the transitional period, a table of minimum prices still in force shall be drawn up.

Prices shall be negotiated between the parties concerned within the framework of directives drawn up by the Commission for the implementation of the preceding two sub-paragraphs. In the event of the first stage being extended, such agreements or contracts shall continue to be carried out under the conditions applicable at the end of the fourth year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, while the obligations to increase quantities and to approximate prices shall be suspended until entry on the second stage.

To the extent that Member States require raw materials for the production of goods destined for export outside the Community in competition with producers in third countries, such agreements or contracts shall not be an obstacle to imports, for this purpose, of raw materials coming from third countries. This provision shall not apply if the Council decides by means of a unanimous vote to grant the payments necessary to compensate, in respect of imports effected for this purpose on the basis of such agreements or contracts, for the excess price paid in comparison with the delivery prices of the same supplies obtained on the world market."
