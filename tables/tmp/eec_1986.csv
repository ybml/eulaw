3.1.X.X.X.4,4,"Article 4 1. The achievement of the tasks entrusted to the Community shall be ensured by an ASSEMBLY, a COUNCIL, a COMMISSION, and a COURT OF JUSTICE. Each of these institutions shall act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by this Treaty. 2. The Council and the Commission shall be assisted by an Economic and Social Committee acting in a consultative capacity."
3.1.X.X.X.5,5,Article 5 Member States shall take all general or particular measures which are appropriate for ensuring the carrying out of the obligations arising out of this Treaty or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Community. They shall facilitate the achievement of the Community’s aims. They shall abstain from any measures likely to jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of this Treaty.
3.1.X.X.X.6,6,"Article 6 1. Member States, acting in close collaboration with the institutions of the Community, shall co-ordinate their respective economic policies to the extent that is necessary to attain the objectives of this Treaty. 2.

3.1.X.X.X.7,7,"Article 7 Within the field of application of this Treaty and without prejudice to the special provisions mentioned therein, any discrimination on the grounds of nationality shall hereby be prohibited. The Council may, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission and in co-operation with the European Parliament, lay down rules in regard to the prohibition of any such discrimination."
3.1.X.X.X.8,8,"Article 8 1. The Common Market shall be progressively established in the course of a transitional period of twelve years. The transitional period shall be divided into three stages of four years each; the length of each stage may be modified in accordance with the provisions set out below. 2. To each stage there shall be allotted a group of actions which shall be undertaken and pursued concurrently. 3. Transition from the first to the second stage shall be conditional upon a confirmatory statement to the effect that the essence of the objectives specifically laid down in this Treaty for the first stage has been in fact achieved and that, subject to the exceptions and procedures provided for in this Treaty, the obligations have been observed. This statement shall be made at the end of the fourth year by the Council acting by means of a unanimous vote on a report of the Commission. The invocation by a Member State of the non-fulfilment of its own obligations shall not, however, be an obstacle to a unanimous vote. Failing a unanimous vote, the first stage shall automatically be extended for a period of one year. At the end of the fifth year, the Council shall make such confirmatory statement under the same conditions. Failing a unanimous vote, the first stage shall automatically be extended for a further period of one year. At the end of the sixth year, the Council shall make such a statement acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a report of the Commission. 4. Within a period of one month as from the date of this last vote, each Member State voting in a minority or, if the required majority vote has not been obtained, any Member State, shall be entitled to require the Council to appoint an Arbitration Board whose decision shall bind all Member States and the institutions of the Community. The Arbitration Board shall be composed of three members appointed by the Council acting by means of a unanimous vote on a proposal of the Commission. If the Council has not, within a period of one month from the date of such requirement, appointed the members of the Arbitration Board, they shall be appointed by the Court of Justice within a further period of one month. The Arbitration Board shall appoint its Chairman. The Board shall give its award within a period of six months from the date of the vote by the Council referred to in paragraph 3, last sub-paragraph. 5. The second and third stages may not be extended or curtailed except pursuant to a decision of the Council acting by means of a unanimous vote on a proposal of the Commission. 6. The provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall not have the effect of extending the transitional period beyond a total duration of fifteen years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. 7. Subject to the exceptions or deviations provided for in this Treaty, the expiry of the transitional period shall constitute the final date for the entry into force of all the rules laid down and for the completion of all the measures required for the establishment of the Common Market."
3.2.1.1.1.12,12,"Article 12 Member States shall refrain from introducing, as between themselves, any new customs duties on importation or exportation or charges with equivalent effect and from increasing such duties or charges as they apply in their commercial relations with each other."
3.2.1.1.1.13,13,"Article 13 1. Customs duties on importation in force between Member States shall be progressively abolished by them in the course of the transitional period under the conditions laid down in Articles 14 and 15. 2. Charges in force between Member States having an effect equivalent to customs duties on importation shall be progressively abolished by them in the course of the transitional period. The Commission shall, by means of directives, fix the timing of such abolition. It shall be guided by the rules mentioned in Article 14, paragraphs 2 and 3, and by the directives issued by the Council in application of the said paragraph 2."
3.2.1.1.1.14,14,"Article 14 1. In respect of each product, the basic duty which shall be subject to the successive reductions shall be the duty applied on 1 January 1957. 2. The timing of the reductions shall be as follows: (a) in the course of the first stage, the first reduction shall be made one year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty; the second reduction shall be made eighteen months later; the third, at the end of the fourth year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty; (b) in the course of the second stage, a reduction shall be made eighteen months after the beginning of that stage; a second reduction, eighteen months after the preceding one; a third reduction shall be made one year later; and (c) the reductions which still remain to be made shall be carried out in the course of the third stage; the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall fix their timing by means of directives. 3. At the time of the first reduction, Member States shall, in respect of each product, bring into force as between themselves a duty equal to the basic duty less 10 per cent. At the time of each subsequent reduction, each Member State shall reduce the total of the duties in such a way as to reduce by 10 per cent its total customs receipts as defined in paragraph 4, it being understood that the reduction in the case of each product shall be equal to at least 5 per cent of the basic duty. In respect of products, however, on which a duty of more than 30 per cent would still remain, each reduction shall be equal to not less than 10 per cent of the basic duty. 4. The total customs receipts of each Member State, referred to in paragraph 3, shall be calculated by multiplying by the basic duties the value of its imports coming from other Member States during the year 1958. 5. Any special problems raised by the application of the preceding paragraphs shall be settled by directives issued by the Council acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission. 6. Member States shall report to the Commission as to the manner in which the preceding rules for the reduction of duties are applied. They shall endeavour to ensure that the reduction applied to the duties on each product shall amount: at the end of the first stage to at least 25 per cent of the basic duty; and at the end of the second stage to at least 50 per cent of the basic duty. If the Commission finds that there is a danger that the objectives laid down in Article 13 and the percentages fixed in this paragraph not be achieved, it shall make any appropriate recommendations to the Member States. 7. The provisions of this Article may be amended by the Council acting by means of a unanimous vote on a proposal of the Commission and after the Assembly has been consulted."
3.2.1.1.1.15,15,"Article 15 1. Independently of the provisions of Article 14, any Member State may, in the course of the transitional period, suspend in whole or in part the collection of the duties applied by it to products imported from other Member States. It shall inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof. 2. Member States hereby declare their willingness to reduce their custom duties in regard to other Member States more rapidly than provided for in Article 14 if their general economic situation and the situation of the sector concerned so permit. The Commission shall make recommendations for this purpose to the Member States concerned."
3.2.1.1.1.16,16,"Article 16 Member States shall abolish as between themselves, not later than at the end of the first stage, the customs duties on exportation and charges with equivalent effect."
3.2.1.1.1.17,17,"Article 17 1. The provisions of Articles 9 to 15, paragraph 1, shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. Such duties shall not, however, be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating either total customs receipts or the reduction in total duties referred to in Article 14, paragraphs 3 and 4. Such duties shall, at each reduction, be lowered by not less than 10 per cent of the basic duty. Member States may reduce their duties more rapidly than is provided for in Article 14. 2. Member States shall, before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Treaty, inform the Commission of their customs duties of a fiscal nature. 3. Member States shall retain the right to substitute for these duties an internal tax in accordance with the provisions of Article 95. 4. Where the Commission finds that in any Member State the substitution of such duty meets with serious difficulties, it shall authorise such State to retain the said duty provided that the State concerned shall abolish it not later than six years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. Such authorisation shall be requested before the end of the first year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty."
3.2.1.1.2.18,18,Article 18 Member States hereby declare their willingness to contribute to the development of international commerce and the reduction of barriers to trade by entering into reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the reduction of customs duties below the general level which they could claim as a result of the establishment of a customs union between themselves.
3.2.1.1.2.19,19,"Article 19 1. Under the conditions and within the limits laid down below, the duties under the common customs tariff shall be at the level of the arithmetical average of the duties applied in the four customs territories covered by the Community. 2. The duties taken into account for calculating this average shall be those applied by Member States on 1 January 1957. In the case of the Italian tariff, however, the duty applied shall be understood as being that levied before the temporary 10 per cent reduction. Furthermore, in the case of tariff headings in regard to which this tariff contains a conventional duty, this duty shall be substituted for the duty applied as defined above, provided that it does not exceed the latter by more than 10 per cent. If the conventional duty exceeds the applied duty as defined above by more than 10 per cent, the latter duty, increased by 10 per cent, shall be taken into account for calculating the arithmetical average. With regard to the tariff headings contained in List A, the duties shown in that List shall, for the purpose of calculating the arithmetical average, be substituted for the duties applied. 3. The duties under the common customs tariff shall not exceed: (a) 3 per cent in the case of products coming under the tariff headings mentioned in List B; (b) 10 per cent in the case of products coming under the tariff headings mentioned in List C; (c) 15 per cent in the case of products coming under the tariff headings mentioned in List D; and (d) 25 per cent in the case of products coming under the tariff headings mentioned in List E; where, in respect of such products, the tariff of the Benelux countries contains a duty of not more than 3 per cent, such duty shall, for the purpose of calculating the arithmetical average, be raised to 12 per cent. 4. The duties applicable to products mentioned in List F shall be those laid down therein. 5. The Lists of tariff headings referred to in this Article and in Article 20 shall be set out in Annex I to this Treaty."
3.2.1.1.2.20,20,"Article 20 The duties applicable to the products in List G shall be fixed by means of negotiation between the Member States. Each Member State may add further products to this List up to the limit of 2 per cent of the total value of its imports coming from third countries in the course of the year 1956. The Commission shall take all appropriate steps in order that such negotiations shall be undertaken before the end of the second year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty and concluded before the end of the first stage. If, in the case of certain products, no agreement can be reached within these time-limits, the Council, acting up to the end of the second stage by means of a unanimous vote and subsequently by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall fix the duties under the common customs tariff."
3.2.1.1.2.21,21,"Article 21 1. Any technical difficulties which may arise in the application of Articles 19 and 20 shall be settled, within a period of two years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, by directives issued by the Council acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission. 2. Before the end of the first stage and, in any case, not later than at the date of the fixing of such duties, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall decide as to the adjustments required with a view to ensuring the internal harmony of the common customs tariff following the application of the rules laid down in Articles 19 and 20, particular account being taken of the degree of processing undergone by the various goods to which the common tariff applies."
3.2.1.1.2.22,22,"Article 22 The Commission shall, within a period of two years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, determine the extent to which the customs duties of a fiscal nature mentioned in Article 17, paragraph 2, shall be taken into account for calculating the arithmetical average referred to in Article 19, paragraph 1. The Commission shall take due account of the protective aspect of such duties. Within a period of not more than six months after the Commission has so determined, any Member State may request that the procedure provided for in Article 20 shall be applied to the product concerned; the limit prescribed in that Article shall not constitute a valid objection."
3.2.1.1.2.23,23,"Article 23 1. For the purpose of the progressive introduction of the common customs tariff, Member States shall amend their tariffs applicable to third countries in the following manner: (a) in the case of tariff headings on which the duties in fact applied on 1 January 1957 do not differ by more than 15 per cent in either direction from the duties under the common customs tariff, the latter duties shall be applied at the end of the fourth year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty; (b) in the case of the other tariff headings, each Member State shall, as from the same date, apply a duty which reduces by 30 per cent the difference between the duty in fact applied on 1 January 1957 and that under the common customs tariff; (c) at the end of the second stage this difference shall again be reduced by 30 per cent; and (d) in the case of tariff headings for which the duties under the common customs tariff are not yet known at the end of the first stage, each Member State shall, within a period of six months after the Council has acted in accordance with the provisions of Article 20, apply such duties as shall result from the application of the rules contained in this paragraph. 2. Any Member State, which has been granted the authorisation provided for in Article 17, paragraph 4, shall, for as long as that authorisation is valid, be exempted from applying the preceding provisions to the tariff headings covered by the authorisation. At the expiry of such authorisation, the Member State concerned shall apply such duty as would result from the application of the rules contained in the preceding paragraph. 3. The common customs tariff shall be applied in its entirety not later than at the date of the expiry of the transitional period."
3.2.1.1.2.24,24,Article 24 With a view to aligning their duties with the common customs tariff; Member States shall be free to modify these duties more rapidly than is provided for in Article 23.
3.2.1.1.2.25,25,"Article 25 1. If the Commission finds that the production in the Member States of certain products contained in Lists B, C and D is not sufficient to supply the demands of one of them and that such supply traditionally depends to a considerable extent upon imports coming from third countries, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall grant to the Member State concerned tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free. Such quotas may not exceed the limits beyond which the transfer of activities to the detriment of other Member States is to be feared. 2. In respect of the products in List E and those in List G for which the duties shall have been fixed in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 20, third paragraph, the Commission shall, at the request of any Member State concerned, grant to such State tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free, where a change in sources of supply or a shortage of supplies within the Community is of such a nature as to entail harmful consequences for the processing industries of the Member State concerned. Such quotas may not exceed the limits beyond which the transfer of activities to the detriment of other Member States is to be feared. 3. In respect of the products listed in Annex II to this Treaty, the Commission may authorise any Member State to suspend, in whole or in part, the collection of the duties applicable or may grant to such Member State tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free, provided that no serious disturbance in the market of the products concerned may result therefrom. 4. The Commission shall periodically examine any tariff quotas granted in application of this Article."
3.2.1.1.2.26,26,"Article 26 The Commission may authorise any Member State encountering special difficulties to postpone the lowering or the raising, in accordance with the provisions of Article 23, of the duties on certain headings of its tariff. Such authorisation may only be granted for a limited period and for tariff headings which together represent for such State not more than 5 per cent of the value of its total imports coming from third countries in the course of the latest year for which statistical data are available."
3.2.1.1.2.27,27,"Article 27 Before the end of the first stage, Member States shall, in so far as may be necessary, take steps to approximate their legislative and administrative provisions in regard to customs matters. The Commission shall for this purpose make all appropriate recommendations to Member States."
3.2.1.1.2.28,28,"Article 28

Any autonomous alteration or suspension of duties in the common customs tariff shall be decided by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission."
3.2.1.1.2.29,29,"Article 29 In carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this Section, the Commission shall be guided by: (a) the need for promoting commercial exchanges between the Member States and third countries; (b) the development of competitive conditions within the Community to the extent to which such development will result in the increase of the competitive capacity of the enterprises; (c) the Community’s requirements of supply in raw materials and semi-finished goods, while at the same time taking care not to distort competitive conditions between Member States with regard to finished goods; and (d) the need for avoiding serious disturbances in the economic life of Member States and for ensuring a rational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the Community."
3.2.1.2.X.30,30,"Article 30 Quantitative restrictions on importation and all measures with equivalent effect shall, without prejudice to the following provisions, hereby be prohibited between Member States."
3.2.1.2.X.31,31,"Article 31 Member States shall refrain from introducing as between themselves any new quantitative restrictions or measures with equivalent effect. This obligation shall, however, only apply to the level of liberalisation attained in application of the decisions of the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation of 14 January 1955. Member States shall communicate to the Commission, not later than six months after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, the lists of the products liberalised by them in application of these decisions. The lists thus communicated shall be consolidated between Member States."
3.2.1.2.X.32,32,"Article 32 Member States shall, in their mutual trade, refrain from making more restrictive the quotas or measures with equivalent effect in existence at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. Such quotas shall be abolished not later than at the date of the expiry of the transitional period. In the course of this period, they shall be progressively abolished under the conditions specified below."
3.2.1.2.X.33,33,"Article 33 1. Each of the Member States shall, at the end of one year after the entry into force of this Treaty, convert any bilateral quotas granted to other Member States into global quotas open, without discrimination, to all other Member States. On the same date, Member States shall enlarge the whole of the global quotas so established in such a way as to attain an increase of not less than 20 per cent in their total value as compared with the preceding year. Each global quota for each product shall, however, be increased by not less than 10 per cent. The quotas shall be increased annually in accordance with the same rules and in the same proportions in relation to the preceding year. The fourth increase shall take place at the end of the fourth year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty; the fifth increase shall take place at the end of a period of one year after the beginning of the second stage. 2. Where, in the case of a product which has not been liberalised, the global quota does not amount to 3 per cent of the national output of the State concerned, a quota equal to not less than 3 per cent of such output shall be established not later than one year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. At the end of the second year, this quota shall be raised to 4 per cent and at the end of the third year to 5 per cent. Thereafter, the Member State concerned shall increase the quota by not less than 15 per cent annually. In the case where there is no such national output, the Commission shall fix an appropriate quota by means of a decision. 3. At the end of the tenth year, each quota shall be equal to not less than 20 per cent of the national output. 4. Where the Commission, acting by means of a decision, finds that in the course of two successive years the imports of any product have been below the level of the quota granted, this global quota may not be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the total value of the global quotas. In such case, the Member State shall abolish the quota for the product concerned. 5. In the case of quotas representing more than 20 per cent of the national output of the product concerned, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may reduce the minimum percentage of 10 per cent laid down in paragraph 1. This modification shall not, however, affect the obligation annually to increase the total value of global quotas by 20 per cent. 6. Member States which have gone beyond their obligations concerning the level of liberalisation attained in implementation of the decisions of the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation of 14 January 1955 shall, when calculating the annual total increase of 20 per cent provided for in paragraph 1, be entitled to take into account the amount of imports liberalised by autonomous measures. Such calculation shall be submitted to the Commission for its prior approval. 7. Directives issued by the Commission shall lay down the procedure and the timing according to which Member States shall abolish as between themselves any measures which exist at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty and which have an effect equivalent to quotas. 8. If the Commission finds that the application of the provisions of this Article and, in particular, of the provisions concerning percentages does not make it possible to ensure the progressive nature of the abolition of quotas provided for in Article 32, second paragraph, the Council, acting during the first stage by means of a unanimous vote and subsequently by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may amend the procedure referred to in this Article and may, in particular, raise the percentages fixed."
3.2.1.2.X.34,34,"Article 34 1. Quantitative restrictions on exportation and any measures with equivalent effect shall hereby be prohibited as between Member States. 2. Member States shall abolish, not later than at the end of the first stage, all quantitative restrictions on exportation and any measures with equivalent effect in existence at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty."
3.2.1.2.X.35,35,"Article 35 Member States hereby declare their willingness to abolish, in relation to other Member States, their quantitative restrictions on importation and exportation more rapidly than is provided for in the preceding Articles, if their general economic situation and the situation of the sector concerned so permit. The Commission shall make recommendations for this purpose to the States concerned."
3.2.1.2.X.36,36,"Article 36 The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 inclusive shall not be an obstacle to prohibitions or restrictions in respect of importation, exportation or transit which are justified on grounds of public morality, public order, public safety, the protection of human or animal life or health, the preservation of plant life, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historical or archaeological value or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute either a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States."
3.2.1.2.X.37,37,"Article 37 1. Member States shall progressively adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character in such a manner as will ensure the exclusion, at the date of the expiry of the transitional period, of all discrimination between the nationals of Members States in regard to conditions of supply or marketing of goods. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body by means of which a Member State shall de jure or de facto either directly or indirectly control, direct or appreciably influence importation or exportation between Member States. These provisions shall apply also to monopolies assigned by the State. 2. Member States shall abstain from any new measure which is contrary to the principles laid down in paragraph 1 or which may limit the scope of the Articles relating to the abolition, as between Member States, of customs duties and quantitative restrictions. 3. The timing of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adapted to the abolition, as provided for in Articles 30 to 34 inclusive, of the quantitative restrictions on the same products. In cases where a product is subject to a State monopoly of a commercial character in one Member State or certain Member States only, the Commission may authorise the other Member States to apply, for as long as the adjustment referred to in paragraph 1 has not been carried out, measures of safeguard of which it shall determine the conditions and particulars. 4. In the case of a monopoly of a commercial character which is accompanied by regulations designed to facilitate the marketing or the valorisation of agricultural products, it should be ensured that in the application of the rules of this Article equivalent guarantees are provided in respect of the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, due account being taken of the timing in respect of possible adjustments and of necessary specialisations. 5. The obligations incumbent on Member States shall be binding only to such extent as they are compatible with existing international agreements. 6. The Commission shall, as soon as the first stage has begun, make recommendations as to the particulars and the timing according to which the adjustments referred to in this Article shall be carried out."
3.2.1.X.X.10,10,"Article 10 1. Products having been entered for consumption in a Member State shall be deemed to be products coming from a third country in cases where, in respect of such products, the necessary import formalities have been complied with and the appropriate customs duties or charges with equivalent effect have been levied in such Member State and where such products have not benefited by any total or partial drawback on such duties or charges. 2. The Commission shall, before the end of the first year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, lay down the methods of administrative co-operation to be adopted for the application of Article 9, paragraph 2, taking due account of the need for reducing as far as possible the formalities imposed on trade. Before the end of the first year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, the Commission shall lay down the provisions applicable, as regards trade between Member States, to goods originating in another Member State in whose manufacture products have been used on which the appropriate customs duties or charges with equivalent effect in the exporting Member State have not been levied or which have benefited by a total or partial drawback on such duties or charges. When laying down such provisions, the Commission shall take due account of the rules for the elimination of customs duties within the Community and for the progressive application of the common customs tariff."
3.2.1.X.X.11,11,"Article 11 The Member States shall take all appropriate measures to enable Governments to carry out, within the time-limits laid down, the obligations with regard to customs duties which are incumbent on them pursuant to this Treaty."
3.2.1.X.X.9,9,"Article 9 1. The Community shall be based upon a customs union covering the exchange of all goods and comprising both the prohibition, as between Member States, of customs duties on importation and exportation and all charges with equivalent effect and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with third countries. 2. The provisions of Chapter 1, Section 1 and of Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to products originating in Member States and also to products coming from third countries and having been entered for consumption in Member States."
3.2.2.X.X.38,38,"Article 38 1. The Common Market shall extend to agriculture and trade in agricultural products. Agricultural products shall mean the products of the soil, of stock-breeding and of fisheries as well as products after the first processing stage which are directly connected with such products. 2. Save where there are provisions to the contrary in Articles 39 to 46 inclusive, the rules laid down for the establishment of the Common Market shall apply to agricultural products. 3. Products subject to the provisions of Articles 39 to 46 inclusive are listed in Annex II to this Treaty. Within a period of two years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall decide as to the products to be added to that list. 4. The functioning and development of the Common Market in respect of agricultural products shall be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy among the Member States."
3.2.2.X.X.39,39,"Article 39 1. The common agricultural policy shall have as its objectives: (a) to increase agricultural productivity by developing technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, particularly labour; (b) to ensure thereby a fair standard of living for the agricultural population, particularly by the increasing of the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture; (c) to stabilise markets; (d) to guarantee regular supplies; and (e) to ensure reasonable prices in supplies to consumers. 2. In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods which it may involve, due account shall be taken of: (a) the particular character of agricultural activities, arising from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions; (b) the need to make the appropriate adjustments gradually; and (c) the fact that in Member States agriculture constitutes a sector which is closely linked with the economy as a whole."
3.2.2.X.X.40,40,"Article 40 1. Member States shall gradually develop the common agricultural policy during the transitional period and shall establish it not later than at the end of that period. 2. With a view to achieving the objectives set out in Article 39, a common organisation of agricultural markets shall be effected. This organisation shall take one of the following forms according to the products concerned: (a) common rules concerning competition; (b) compulsory co-ordination of the various national market organisations; or (c) a European market organisation. 3. The common organisation in one of the forms mentioned in paragraph 2 may comprise all measures necessary to achieve the objectives set out in Article 39, in particular, price controls, subsidies as to the production and marketing of various products, arrangements for stock-piling and carry-forward, and common machinery for stabilising importation or exportation. The organisation shall confine itself to pursuing the objectives set out in Article 39 and shall exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers within the Community. A common price policy, if any, shall be based on common criteria and on uniform methods of calculation. 4. In order to enable the common organisation referred to in paragraph 2 to achieve its objectives, one or more agricultural orientation and guarantee funds may be established."
3.2.2.X.X.41,41,"Article 41 In order to permit the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 39, provision may be made within the framework of the common agricultural policy for, inter alia: (a) an effective co-ordination of efforts undertaken in the spheres of occupational training, research and the popularisation of rural economy, which may involve projects or institutions financed jointly; and (b) common action for the development of the consumption of certain products."
3.2.2.X.X.42,42,"Article 42 The provisions of the Chapter relating to the rules of competition shall apply to the production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the Council within the framework of the provisions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43, paragraphs 2 and 3, due account being taken of the objectives mentioned in Article 39. The Council may, in particular, authorise the granting of aids: (a) for the protection of enterprises handicapped by structural or natural conditions; and (b) within the framework of economic development programmes."
3.2.2.X.X.43,43,"Article 43 1. In order to formulate the guiding lines of a common agricultural policy, the Commission shall, upon the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, convene a conference of Member States, with a view to comparing their agricultural policies by drawing up, in particular, a statement of their resources and needs. 2. The Commission, taking due account of the work of the conference provided for in paragraph 1, shall, after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and within a period of two years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, submit proposals concerning the working out and putting into effect of the common agricultural policy, including the substitution of national organisations by one of the forms of common organisation provided for in Article 40, paragraph 2, as well as concerning the putting into effect of the measures specially mentioned under this Title. These proposals shall take due account of the interdependence of the agricultural questions raised under this Title. The Council, acting during the first two stages by means of a unanimous vote and subsequently by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission and after the Assembly has been consulted, shall issue regulations or directives or take decisions, without prejudice to any recommendations which it may make. The common organisation provided for in Article 40, paragraph 2, may, under the conditions provided for in the preceding paragraph, be substituted for national market organisations by the Council acting by means of a qualified majority vote: (a) if the common organisation offers to Member States which are opposed to this measure and which possess a national organisation of their own for the production concerned, equivalent guarantees regarding the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, due account being taken of the time-factor in respect of possible adjustments and of necessary specialisations; and (b) if such organisation ensures for exchanges within the Community conditions similar to those existing in a domestic market. 4. If a common organisation is created for certain raw materials at a time when no common organisation yet exists for the corresponding processed products, the raw materials concerned which are used for processed products destined for export to third countries may be imported from outside the Community."
3.2.2.X.X.44,44,"Article 44 1. In the course of the transitional period and to the extent that the progressive abolition of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between Member States may result in prices likely to jeopardise the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 39, each Member State shall be permitted to apply to certain products, in a non-discriminatory manner and in substitution for quotas, to such an extent as shall not impede the expansion of the volume of trade provided for in Article 45, paragraph 2, a system of minimum prices below which imports may be: temporarily suspended or reduced; or made conditional on their price being above the minimum price fixed for the product concerned. In the second case, the minimum prices shall not include customs duties. 2. The minimum prices shall not be such as to lead to a reduction of exchanges existing between Member States at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty and shall not be an obstacle to a progressive expansion of such exchanges. The minimum prices shall not be applied in such a manner as to be an obstacle to the development of a natural preference between the Member States. 3. Upon the entry unto force of this Treaty, the Council, acting on a proposal of the Commission, shall determine objective criteria for the establishment of minimum price systems and for the fixing of such prices. The criteria shall, in particular, take account of average national costs of production in the Member State applying the minimum price, of the situation of the various enterprises in relation to such costs and of the need for promoting both the progressive improvement of agricultural operations and the adjustments and specialisations necessary within the Common Market. The Commission shall also propose a procedure for revision of these criteria in order to take into account and accelerate technical progress and in order progressively to approximate prices within the Common Market. These criteria and the procedure for revision shall be determined by means of a unanimous vote of the Council in the course of the first three years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. 4. Until the Council’s decision takes effect, Member States may fix minimum prices on condition that they previously communicate them to the Commission and to the other Member States in order to enable them to submit their comments. As soon as the Council has taken its decision, Member States shall fix minimum prices on the basis of the criteria established under the conditions mentioned above. The Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may correct the decisions taken if they do not conform to the criteria so determined. 5. From the beginning of the third stage and in cases where it has not yet been possible in respect of certain products to establish the above objective criteria, the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, may modify the minimum prices applied to these products. 6. At the expiry of the transitional period, a table of minimum prices still in force shall be drawn up. The Council, acting on a proposal of the Commission by means of a majority of nine votes in accordance with the weighting provided for in Article 14.8, paragraph 2, first sub-paragraph, shall determine the system to be applied within the framework of the common agricultural policy."
3.2.2.X.X.45,45,"Article 45 1. Until the substitution of the national organisation by one of the forms of common organisation provided for in Article 40, paragraph 2, the development of exchanges in respect of products for which there exist in certain Member States: provisions designed to guarantee to national producers a sale of their production, and a need of imports, shall be pursued by the conclusion of long-term agreements or contracts between exporting and importing Member States. Such agreements or contracts shall be directed towards the progressive abolition of any discrimination in the application of these provisions to the various producers within the Community. The conclusion of such agreements or contracts shall take place in the course of the first stage; due account shall be taken of the principle of reciprocity. 2. With regard to quantities, such agreements or contracts shall take as their basis the average volume of exchanges between Member States in the products concerned during the three years preceding the date of the entry into force of this Treaty and shall provide for an increase in that volume within the limit of existing requirements, due account being taken of traditional trade currents. With regard to prices, such agreements or contracts shall enable producers to dispose of the agreed quantities at prices progressively approximating to those paid to national producers in the home market of the purchasing country. This approximating of prices shall proceed as steadily as possible and shall be completed not later than at the end of the transitional period. Prices shall be negotiated between the parties concerned within the framework of directives drawn up by the Commission for the implementation of the preceding two sub-paragraphs. In the event of the first stage being extended, such agreements or contracts shall continue to be carried out under the conditions applicable at the end of the fourth year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, while the obligations to increase quantities and to approximate prices shall be suspended until entry on the second stage. Member States shall avail themselves of any possibilities offered to them as a result of their legislative provisions, particularly as regards import policy, with a view to ensuring the conclusion and carrying out of these agreements or contracts. 3. To the extent that Member States require raw materials for the production of goods destined for export outside the Community in competition with producers in third countries, such agreements or contracts shall not be an obstacle to imports, for this purpose, of raw materials coming from third countries. This provision shall not apply if the Council decides by means of a unanimous vote to grant the payments necessary to compensate, in respect of imports effected for this purpose on the basis of such agreements or contracts, for the excess price paid in comparison with the delivery prices of the same supplies obtained on the world market."

The Commission shall fix the amount of these charges, to the extent necessary to re-establish the balance; it may also authorise recourse to other measures of which it shall determine the conditions. and particulars."
