The Commission may require such information only for the purpose of ascertaining that such agreement or convention does not contain clauses impeding the application of this Treaty. On a petition by the Commission, the Court of Justice shall rule as to the compatibility of such agreement or convention with the provisions of this Treaty."
2.2.10.X.105,105,"Article 105 The provisions of this Treaty may not be invoked as an obstacle to the implementation of any agreement or convention concluded before the date of the entry into force of this Treaty by a Member State, a person or enterprise with a third country, an international organisation or a national of a third country, where such agreement or convention has been communicated to the Commission not later than thirty days after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty. An agreement or convention concluded during the period between the signature and the date of the entry into force of this Treaty by a person or enterprise with a third country, an international organisation or a national of a third country may not be invoked as an obstacle to this Treaty if, in the opinion of the Court of Justice ruling on a petition by the Commission, one of the essential motives of either of the parties in concluding such agreement or convention was to evade the provisions of this Treaty."
2.2.10.X.106,106,"Article 106 Member States which, before the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, have concluded agreements with third countries for co-operation in the field of nuclear energy shall, jointly with the Commission, enter into the necessary negotiations with such third countries in order, as far as possible, to cause the rights and obligations arising out of such agreements to be assumed by the Community.

The Commission shall, on the same conditions, grant sub-licences of patents, provisionally protected claims, utility models or patent applications, where the Community holds contractual licences conferring this right. The Commission shall grant these licences or sub-licences on conditions to be settled by agreement with the licensee and shall make available all information necessary for exploiting them. These conditions shall cover, in particular, the question of suitable compensation and, where appropriate, the right of the licensee to grant sub-licences to third parties and the obligation to treat the information imparted as trade secrets. If agreement on the conditions provided for in the third paragraph cannot be reached, the licensee may, with a view to the settlement of suitable conditions, refer the matter to the Court of Justice."
2.2.2.1.13,13,"Article 13 The Commission shall communicate to Member States, persons or enterprises any information acquired by the Community which is not covered by the provisions of Article 12, irrespective of whether such information results from the implementation of the Community’s research programme or is communicated to the Commission with the right to make free use of it. The Commission may, however, make the communication of this information conditional on its being treated as confidential and not transmitted to third parties. The Commission may communicate information acquired subject to restrictions upon its use and dissemination — such as “classified” information — if it ensures observance of these restrictions."
2.2.2.2.14,14,"Article 14 The Commission shall, by friendly means, endeavour to obtain or to cause to be obtained, the communication of information useful to the Community in the pursuit of its objects and the granting of licences to exploit patents, provisionally protected claims, utility models or patent applications relating to such information."
2.2.2.2.15,15,"Article 15 The Commission shall arrange a procedure by which Member States, persons or enterprises may use it as an intermediary to exchange provisional or final results of their research in so far as these are not results acquired by the Community under research contracts granted by the Commission.

As soon as an application for a patent or a utility model relating to a specifically nuclear subject is filed with a Member State, the latter shall ask the applicant to consent to the contents of the application being immediately communicated to the Commission. If the applicant so consents, this communication shall be made within a period of three months after the date of the filing of the application. If the applicant does not so consent, the Member State shall, within the same period, notify the Commission of the existence of the application. The Commission may require the Member State to communicate to it the contents of an application of whose existence it has been notified. The Commission shall make this demand within a period of two months after the date of the notification. Any extension of this period shall cause the period mentioned in the sixth sub-paragraph to be similarly extended. The Member State shall, on receiving the Commission’s demand again ask the applicant to consent to the communication of the contents of his application. If the applicant so consents, the communication shall be made forthwith. If the applicant does not so consent, the Member State shall nevertheless make the communication to the Commission after a period of eighteen months from the date of the filing of the application. 2. Member States shall notify the Commission, within a period of eighteen months from the date of its filing, of the existence of any unpublished application for a patent or utility model which appears prima facie to them to deal with a subject that, without being of a specifically nuclear nature, is directly connected with and essential to the development of nuclear energy within the Community. The contents of the application shall, at the demand of the Commission, be communicated to it within a period of two months. 3. Member States shall, in order that publication may take place as soon as possible, reduce to a minimum the time taken by the procedure in respect of applications for patents or utility models relating to the subjects referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and concerning which the Commission has made a demand. 4. The Commission shall consider the above-mentioned communications as confidential. They must not serve any other purpose than that of documentation. The Commission may, however, make use of the inventions communicated to it either with the consent of the applicant or in accordance with Articles 17 to 23 inclusive. 5. The provisions of this Article shall not apply if an agreement concluded with a third country or with an international organisation precludes communication."
2.2.2.2.17,17,"Article 17 1. Failing an amicable arrangement, non-exclusive licences may be granted, either by means of arbitration or ex officio, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Articles 18 to 23 inclusive: (a) to the Community or to Joint Enterprises entitled to them under the terms of Article 48 in respect of patents, provisionally protected claims or utility models relating to inventions directly connected with nuclear research, in so far as the granting of such licences is necessary to the pursuit of their own research or indispensable for the operating of their facilities. Such licences shall, at the request of the Commission, include the right to authorise third parties to use the invention in so far as they are carrying out work or orders for the Community or for Joint Enterprises; or (b) to persons or enterprises having made an application to the Commission therefor, in respect of patents, provisionally protected claims or utility models relating to inventions directly connected with and essential to the development of nuclear energy within the Community, provided that all the following conditions arc fulfilled, namely: (i) that a period of at least four years has elapsed since the filing of the application for a patent, save in the case of an invention relating to a specifically nuclear subject; (i) that a period of at least four years has elapsed since the filing of the application for a patent, save in the case of an invention relating to a specifically nuclear subject; (ii) that the needs arising from the development of nuclear energy in the territories of a Member State where an invention is protected, as the Commission understands that development, are not met in respect of that invention; (ii) that the needs arising from the development of nuclear energy in the territories of a Member State where an invention is protected, as the Commission understands that development, are not met in respect of that invention; (iii) that the owner, having been asked to satisfy these needs either personally or through his licensees, has not done so; and (iii) that the owner, having been asked to satisfy these needs either personally or through his licensees, has not done so; and (iv) that the persons or enterprises applying for licences are in a position effectively to meet these needs by exploiting the licences. (iv) that the persons or enterprises applying for licences are in a position effectively to meet these needs by exploiting the licences. Except at the prior demand of the Commission, Member States may not, in order to meet the aforesaid needs, take any coercive measure provided for under their municipal law, where the effect of such measure would be to limit the protection accorded to the invention. 2. A non-exclusive licence may not be granted under the conditions laid down in the preceding paragraph if the owner establishes a legitimate reason, in particular the fact that he has not had an adequate period of time at his disposal. 3. The granting of a licence under the terms of paragraph 1 confers the right to full compensation, the amount of which shall be agreed between the holder of the patent, provisionally protected claim or utility model and the licensee. 4. The provisions of this Article shall not affect the provisions of the Paris Convention for the protection of industrial property."
2.2.2.2.18,18,"Article 18 An Arbitration Committee shall hereby be established for the purposes stated in this Section; its members shall be appointed and its rules of procedure laid down by the Council acting on a proposal of the Court of Justice. Decisions of the Arbitration Committee may, within a period of one month after their notification, be the subject of appeals brought by the parties before the Court of Justice to stay execution. The Court may decide only upon the regularities of form of the decision and upon the interpretation given by the Arbitration Committee to the provisions of this Treaty. The final decisions of the Arbitration Committee shall have the force of res judicata as between the parties. They shall be enforceable under the provisions laid down in Article 164."
2.2.2.2.19,19,"Article 19 Where, failing an amicable arrangement, the Commission proposes to have a licence granted in a case provided for under Article 17, it shall notify the holder of the patent, provisionally protected claim or utility model or the applicant for the patent accordingly, giving in its notification the name of the applicant for, and the scope of the said licence."
2.2.2.2.20,20,"Article 20 The owner may, within a period of one month after the receipt of the notification mentioned in Article 19, propose to the Commission and, where necessary, to the third party applying for the licence that a compromise be concluded for the purpose of referring the matter to the Arbitration Committee. If the Commission or the said third party refuses to conclude a compromise, the Commission may not require the Member State or its competent agencies to grant the licence or to cause it to be granted. If, when the matter comes before it under the compromise, the Arbitration Committee rules that the Commission’s demand is in conformity with the provisions of Article 17, it shall give a reasoned decision ordering the granting of the licence to the applicant and determining the conditions to be observed and the compensation to be made, in so far as the parties have not reached agreement thereon."
2.2.2.2.21,21,"Article 21 If the owner does not propose to refer the matter to the Arbitration Committee, the Commission may require the Member State concerned or its competent agencies to grant the licence or to cause it to be granted. If, after hearing the owner, the Member State or its competent agencies consider that the conditions laid down in Article 17 have not been fulfilled, they shall notify the Commission of their refusal to grant the licence or to cause it to be granted. If they refuse to grant the licence or to cause it to be granted or if, within a period of four months after the date of the demand, they fail to make any statement concerning the granting of the licence, the Commission may, within a period of two months, refer the matter to the Court of Justice. The owner shall be heard in the proceedings before the Court of Justice. If the judgment of the Court establishes that the conditions laid down in Article 17 have been fulfilled, the Member State concerned or its competent agencies shall take the measures required for the execution of that judgment."
2.2.2.2.22,22,"Article 22 1. If the owner of the patent, provisionally protected claim or utility model and the licensee fail to agree on the amount of compensation due, the interested parties may conclude a compromise for the purpose of referring the matter to the Arbitration Committee. They thereby waive all right of appeal except as provided for under Article 18. 2. If the licensee refuses to conclude such compromise, the licence granted to him shall be deemed to be null and void. If the owner refuses to conclude such compromise, the compensation provided for in this Article shall be determined by the competent national agencies."
2.2.2.2.23,23,Article 23 The decisions of the Arbitration Committee or of the competent national agencies shall be subject to revision in respect of the conditions of the licence after the expiry of a period of one year and in so far as new facts justify such revision. Revision shall be incumbent upon the agency which gave the decision.
2.2.2.3.24,24,"Article 24 Information which is acquired by the Community through the implementation of its research programme and the disclosure of which might be harmful to the defence interests of one or more Member States shall be treated as classified information in accordance with the following conditions: 1. Security regulations adopted by the Council on a proposal of the Commission shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, determine the various security gradings applicable, and the security measures to be enforced, in respect of each grade. 2. The Commission shall provisionally apply the grading required by the security regulations to any information the disclosure of which it considers might be harmful to the defence interests of one or more Member States. It shall immediately communicate such information to Member States which shall provisionally ensure its security in accordance with the same conditions. Member States shall, within a period of three months, inform the Commission whether they wish to maintain the grading provisionally applied, to substitute another grading or to declassify the information. At the end of this period, the strictest of those gradings so required shall be applied. The Commission shall notify Member States thereof. At the request of the Commission or of a Member State, the Council, acting by means of a unanimous vote, may at any time apply a different grading or declassify the information. The Council shall, before ruling on such request by a Member State, obtain the opinion of the Commission. 3. The provisions of Articles 12 and 13 shall not apply to classified information. Subject, however, to the observance of the security measures applicable, (a) the information referred to in Articles 12 and 13 may be communicated by the Commission (i) to a Joint Enterprise; or (i) to a Joint Enterprise; or (ii) to a person or enterprise other than a Joint Enterprise through the intermediary of the Member State in whose territories the said person or enterprise is operating; (ii) to a person or enterprise other than a Joint Enterprise through the intermediary of the Member State in whose territories the said person or enterprise is operating; (b) the information referred to in Article 13 may be communicated by a Member State to a person or enterprise, other than a Joint Enterprise, operating in the territories of that State, provided that the Commission is notified of such communication; and (c) moreover, each Member State has the right to require the Commission to grant a licence in accordance with Article 12 for the needs of such Member State or for the needs of a person or enterprise operating in its territories."
2.2.2.3.25,25,"Article 25 1. A Member State communicating the existence or the contents of an application for a patent or utility model relating to a subject referred to in Article 16, paragraph 1 or 2, shall, where appropriate, state the need for defence reasons of applying to that application the security grading indicated by such State and shall mention the probable duration of such grading. The Commission shall transmit to other Member States all communications received in implementation of the preceding subparagraph. The Commission and the Member States shall observe the measures necessitated under the security regulations by the grading which the originating State has required. 2. The Commission may also transmit these communications to Joint Enterprises or, through the intermediary of a Member State, to a person or enterprise other than a Joint Enterprise, operating in the territories of that State. Inventions which are the subject of the applications referred to in paragraph 1 may be only used with the consent of the applicant or in accordance with the provisions of Articles 17 to 23 inclusive. The communications and, where appropriate, the uses referred to in this paragraph shall be governed by the measures necessitated under the security regulations by the grading which the originating State has required. Such communications and uses shall in all cases be subject to the consent of the originating State. The latter may not refuse its consent except for defence reasons. 3. At the request of the Commission or of a Member State the Council, acting by means of a unanimous vote, may at any time apply a different security grading or declassify the invention. The Council shall, before ruling on a request from a Member State, obtain the opinion of the Commission."
2.2.2.3.26,26,"Article 26 1. Where information forming the subject of a patent, patent application, provisionally protected claim, utility model or application for a utility model is classified in accordance with the provisions of Articles 24 and 25, the States requiring a certain grading may not refuse to allow corresponding applications to be filed in the other Member States. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure the maintenance of security for all such titles, applications and claims, in accordance with the procedure laid down by its domestic legislative provisions. 2. No applications may be filed outside Member States in respect of information classified in accordance with Article 24 save by the unanimous consent of Member States. If these States do not declare their attitude, their consent shall be presumed after the expiry of a period of six months from the date of the communication of the information by the Commission to Member States."
2.2.2.3.27,27,"Article 27 Compensation for damage suffered by an applicant as a result of the imposition of the security classification for defence reasons shall be subject to the provisions of the municipal law of Member States and shall be the responsibility of the State which has requested such classification or procured an upgrading or an extension of such classification or prevented the filing of an application outside the Community. In the event of two or more Member States having procured an upgrading or an extension of classification or having prevented the filing of an application outside the Community, such States shall be jointly and severally liable for making reparation for the resultant damage. The Community shall not be entitled to claim any compensation under the terms of this Article."

In the event of such persons having the right to take action against third parties, the Community shall, without prejudice to its own claims against the author of the damage, be substituted for such persons to the extent that it has borne the cost of making reparation for the damage suffered. The right of the Community itself to take action, in accordance with general provisions in force, against the author of the damage shall not be affected."
2.2.2.4.29,29,"Article 29 Any agreement or contract for the purpose of exchanging scientific or industrial information on nuclear matters between a Member State, person or enterprise and any third country, international organisation or national of a third country shall, if it requires on either part the signature of a State exercising its sovereignty, be concluded by the Commission. Nevertheless, the Commission may, on such conditions as it deems proper, authorise a Member State, a person or enterprise to conclude such agreements, subject to the application of the provisions of Articles 103 and 104."
2.2.3.X.30,30,Article 30 Basic standards for the protection of the health of workers and of the general public from the dangers arising from ionising radiation shall be established within the Community.

2.2.5.X.46,46,"Article 46 1. Any project for the establishment of a Joint Enterprise, whether originating from the Commission, a Member State or any other source, shall be the subject of an enquiry by the Commission. For this purpose, the Commission shall consult Member States and any public or private bodies which it considers likely to provide useful information. 2. The Commission shall transmit to the Council any project for the establishment of a Joint Enterprise, together with its reasoned opinion thereon. If the Commission gives a favourable opinion regarding the need for such Joint Enterprise, it shall submit proposals to the Council on the following points: (a) location of plant; (b) statutes; (c) volume and rate of financing; (d) possible participation by the Community in the financing of the Joint Enterprise; (e) possible participation by a third country, an international organisation or a national of a third country in the financing or management of the Joint Enterprise; and (f) the granting of all or any of the advantages specified in Annex III to this Treaty. The Commission shall attach a detailed report on the project as a whole."
2.2.5.X.47,47,"Article 47 The Council may, on a reference to it by the Commission, ask the latter to supply such additional information or to carry out such additional enquiries as the Council may deem necessary. If the Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote, considers that a project transmitted by the Commission with an unfavourable opinion should nevertheless be carried out, the Commission shall submit to the Council the proposals and detailed report referred to in Article 46. In the case of a favourable opinion by the Commission or in the case referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Council shall act by means of a qualified majority vote on each of the Commission’s proposals. The Council shall, however, act by means of a unanimous vote with regard to: (a) participation by the Community in the financing of the Joint Enterprise; and (b) participation by a third country, an international organisation or a national of a third country in the financing or management of the Joint Enterprise."
2.2.5.X.48,48,"Article 48 The Council, acting by means of a unanimous vote on a proposal of the Commission, may declare applicable to each Joint Enterprise all or any of the advantages specified in Annex III to this Treaty; Member States shall ensure the application of such advantages to the extent that each State is concerned. The Council may, in accordance with the same procedure, determine the conditions by which the granting of such advantages shall be governed."
2.2.5.X.49,49,"Article 49 The constitution of a Joint Enterprise shall result from a decision of the Council. Each Joint Enterprise shall have legal personality. Each Joint Enterprise shall, in each of the Member States, enjoy the most extensive legal capacity accorded to legal persons under their respective municipal law; it may, in particular, acquire and transfer movable and immovable property and may sue or be sued in its own name. Unless otherwise provided for in this Treaty or in its statutes, each Joint Enterprise shall be subject to the rules applying to industrial or commercial undertakings; the statutes may make subsidiary reference to the municipal law of Member States. Subject to the powers conferred on the Court of Justice by this Treaty, litigation concerning Joint Enterprises shall be dealt with by the competent domestic courts or tribunals."
2.2.5.X.50,50,"Article 50 The statutes of Joint Enterprises shall, where appropriate, be amended in accordance with the particular provisions set out for that purpose in the said statutes. Such amendments shall not, however, enter into force until they have received the approval of the Council acting on a proposal of the Commission and in accordance with the same provisions as are set out in Article 47."
2.2.5.X.51,51,"Article 51 The Commission shall, prior to the setting up of the bodies charged with the operation of the Joint Enterprises, ensure the carrying out of all decisions of the Council concerning the constitution of such enterprises."
2.2.6.1.53,53,"Article 53 The Agency shall be placed under the control of the Commission which shall issue directives to it, exercise a right of veto over its decisions and appoints its Director-General and Deputy Director-General. Any act of the Agency, whether implicit or explicit, in the exercise of its right of option or its exclusive right to conclude supply contracts, may be referred by the parties concerned to the Commission which shall, within a period of one month, take a decision thereon."
2.2.6.1.54,54,"Article 54 The Agency shall have legal personality and financial autonomy. The Council, acting by means of a qualified majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, shall lay down the Statute of the Agency. This Statute may be revised in accordance with the same procedure. The Statute shall determine the Agency’s capital and the terms of subscription. The majority of the shares shall in any case belong to the Community and to the Member States. The allotment of the shares shall be determined by the Member States acting in common agreement. The Statute shall determine the particulars of the commercial management of the Agency. The Statute may provide for the payment of a tax on transactions designed to cover the operating expenses of the Agency."

The Member States may constitute one or more bodies competent to represent producers and users in the non-European territories under their jurisdiction in respect of the dealings of such producers and users with the Agency."
2.2.6.2.57,57,"Article 57 1. The Agency’s right of option shall cover: (a) the acquisition of user and consumer rights in respect of materials owned by the Community pursuant to the provisions of Chapter VIII; and (b) the acquisition of rights of ownership in all other cases. 2. The Agency shall exercise its right of option by the conclusion of contracts with producers of ores, source materials and special fissionable materials. Subject to the provisions of Articles 58, 62 and 63, every producer shall, prior to their use, transfer or stockpiling, offer to the Agency any ores, source materials or special fissionable materials which he may produce in the territories of Member States."
2.2.6.2.58,58,"Article 58 When a producer carries out several stages of production from the extraction of the ore up to and including the production of the metal, he shall offer his product to the Agency at any stage of production chosen by him. The same provision shall apply to two or more enterprises having ties with each other, provided that such ties have been duly notified to the Commission and discussed with it in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 43 and 44:"
2.2.6.2.59,59,"Article 59 If the Agency does not exercise its right of option as to the whole or part of the output of a producer, the latter: (a) may have the ores, source materials or special fissionable materials transformed, either by his own means or under sub-contract, provided that he offers to the Agency the product of such transformation, and (b) shall be authorised by decision of the Commission to dispose of his available production outside the Community, provided that he offers it on terms no more favourable than those of his previous offer to the Agency. The export of special fissionable materials may, however, in accordance with the provisions of Article 62, be carried out only by the Agency. The Commission may not grant the authorisation referred to above if the persons to whom delivery is to be made do not offer all possible guarantees that the general interests of the Community will be respected or if the terms and conditions of the contracts concerned are contrary to the aims of this Treaty."
2.2.6.2.60,60,"Article 60 Potential users shall periodically inform the Agency of their requirements in the matter of supplies, specifying the quantities, physical and chemical properties, place of origin, proposed use, delivery dates and price terms which are to be included in the terms and conditions of the supply contract which they wish to conclude. Similarly, producers shall inform the Agency of offers which they are in a position to make, together with full particulars, including the duration of contracts, necessary to enable them to draw up their production programmes. The duration of such contracts shall not, except with the agreement of the Commission, exceed a period of ten years. The Agency shall inform all potential users of the offers and of the volume of the demands received by it and shall invite them to place their orders by a given date. The Agency shall, after receiving all such orders, make known the conditions on which it can fulfil them. If the Agency is unable completely to fulfil all the orders received, it shall, subject to the provisions of Articles 68 and 69, allocate in respect of each offer the available supplies prorata to the orders. Agency regulations, to be submitted to the Commission for approval, shall determine the manner in which offers and demands are to be compared."
2.2.6.2.61,61,"Article 61 The Agency shall fulfil each order received unless there are legal or material obstacles to its execution. The Agency may, subject to compliance with the provisions of Article 52, require users to make suitable advance payments on the conclusion of a contract, either as security or in order to facilitate such of its own long-term obligations to producers as are necessary to the execution of the order."
2.2.6.2.62,62,"Article 62 1. The Agency shall exercise its right of option as to special fissionable materials produced in the territories of Member States in order: (a) to meet the demands of users within the Community in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 60; (b) itself to stock such materials; or (c) to export such materials subject to the authorisation of the Commission which shall comply with the provisions of Article 59, paragraph (b), second sub-paragraph. 2. Nevertheless, while continuing to be subject to the provisions of Chapter VII, these materials and their fertile residues shall be left in the possession of the producer, in order that the latter may: (a) stock them with the authorisation of the Agency; (b) use them within the limits of his own requirements; or (c) make them available, within the limits of their requirements, to enterprises within the Community which have direct ties with him, for the purpose of carrying out a programme duly communicated to the Commission; provided that such ties do not, in intention or in fact, restrict production, technical development or investment or improperly create inequalities between users within the Community. 3. The provisions of Article 89, paragraph 1, (a), shall apply to any special fissionable materials in respect of which the Agency has not exercised its right of option and which are produced in the territories of Member States."
2.2.6.2.63,63,"Article 63 Any ores, source materials or special fissionable materials produced by Joint Enterprises shall be allotted to users in accordance with the statutory or conventional rules governing such Enterprises."

2.2.6.3.65,65,"Article 65 The provisions of Article 60 shall apply to demands from users and to contracts entered into between users and the Agency concerning the supply of ores, source materials or special fissionable materials coming from outside the Community. The Agency may, however, decide as to the geographical origin of the supplies provided that in doing so it ensures for the user conditions at least as favourable as those specified in his order."
2.2.6.3.66,66,"Article 66 Where the Commission finds, at a request from the users concerned, that the Agency is unable, within a reasonable period, to fulfil either in whole or in part an order for supplies or is able to fulfil it only at an excessive price, users shall have the right to conclude direct contracts for supplies coming from outside the Community, provided that such contracts correspond substantially to their requirements as specified in their order. Such right shall be granted for a period of one year and shall be renewable where the situation originally justifying the grant of such right continues to exist. Users availing themselves of the right provided for in this Article shall communicate to the Commission any proposed direct contracts. The Commission may, within a period of one month, oppose the conclusion of such contracts if they are contrary to the aims of this Treaty."
2.2.6.4.67,67,"Article 67 Subject to the exceptions provided for in this Treaty, prices shall result from the comparison of offer and demand, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 60; Member States may not, by means of domestic provisions, contravene these provisions."
2.2.6.4.68,68,"Article 68 All price manipulations designed to ensure a privileged position for certain users, which are contrary to the principle of equal access resulting from the provisions of this Chapter, shall be forbidden. If the Agency finds that any such practices exist, it shall report them to the Commission. If the Commission considers that the Agency’s findings are well founded, it may, in the case of disputed offers, restore the prices to a level compatible with the principle of equal access."
2.2.6.4.69,69,"Article 69 The Council may fix prices acting by means of a unanimous vote on a proposal of the Commission. Where the Agency, in applying the provisions of Article 60, determines the conditions on which orders may be fulfilled, it may propose price adjustments to any users who have placed orders with it."
2.2.6.5.70,70,"Article 70 The Commission may, within the limits set out in the budget of the Community, contribute financially, on conditions laid down by itself, to any prospecting activities in the territories of Member States. The Commission may make recommendations to Member States with a view to the development of prospecting for and the exploitation of mineral deposits. Member States shall submit annually to the Commission a report on the development of prospecting and production, on probable reserves and on mining investment effected or proposed in their territories. Such reports shall be submitted to the Council together with the opinion of the Commission, which shall in particular concern the action taken by Member States on the recommendations made to them in accordance with the preceding paragraph. Where, on such reference to it by the Commission, the Council by means of a qualified majority vote finds that, in spite of extraction possibilities appearing economically justifiable on a long-term basis, the measures taken for prospecting and the increase in the exploitation of mineral deposits continue to be substantially inadequate, the Member State concerned shall, for as long as it has not corrected this state of affairs, be deemed to have relinquished, both for itself and for its nationals, the right of equal access to other such resources within the Community."

2.2.6.6.74,74,"Article 74 The Commission may exempt from the application of the provisions of this Chapter the transfer, importation or exportation of such small quantities of ores, source materials or special fissionable materials as are commonly used for purposes of research. Any transfer, importation or exportation effected pursuant to this provision shall be notified to the Agency."

The persons or enterprises concerned shall, however, notify the Agency of the existence of any such undertakings and also, upon signature of the contract, of the amounts of materials involved. The Commission may oppose the undertakings referred to in sub-paragraph (b) if it considers that the transformation or shaping involved cannot be carried out efficiently, safely and without loss of material to the detriment of the Community. All materials covered by such undertakings shall, as long as they are within the territories of Members States, be subject to the measures of control provided for in Chapter VII. The provisions of Chapter VIII shall not apply to any special fissionable materials covered by undertakings referred to in sub-paragraph (c)."

The Commission shall examine any such request made by a Member State. The Council may, at the end of a period of seven years after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, confirm these provisions in toto. Failing such confirmation, new provisions dealing with the subject-matter of this Chapter shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure set out in the preceding paragraph."
